About Sequence Protocol
    A sequence is a list of values that you can step through one at a time
    
    struct Countdown: Sequence, IteratorProtocol {
    var count: Int

    mutating func next() -> Int? {
        if count == 0 {
            return nil
        } else {
            defer { count -= 1 }
            return count
        }
    }
}

defer = uncommon to use

    A defer statement is used for executing code just before transferring program control outside of the scope that the statement appears in.

func printStringNumbers() {
    defer { print("1") }
    defer { print("2") }
    defer { print("3") }

    print("4")
}

/// Prints 4, 3, 2, 1
